    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe are interested in finding out who the susceptible victims for a certain crime are. We have picked LA as it is a populous city with a diverse set of people living in it. There have been multiple studies and claims that portray certain groups, certain crimes and certain areas as more susceptible to danger.We want to see what the conclusions can be for LA.\nUSA Today claims that the crime rate in LA soared by 114% in certain neighborhoods of LA from 2019 to 2022. These assertions piqued our interest in these questions[1].\nThe questions we want to answer are:\n\nWe want to know how factors like race, gender, area, time of crime and category of the crime affect the crime and who the victim might be.\nWe want to see if COVID-19 has affected crime rates and what that affect has been.\nHow the crime rates have progressed over the years for different neighborhoods.\n\nThis in turn can help us determine the likelihood of certain crime occurring based on the factors and we can take preventive measures towards it. We will see if there correlation between the crimes and certain factors which can help us take decide on the precautionary measures to be taken in the future."
