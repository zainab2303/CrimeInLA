    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project aims to understand, analyze and visualize crimes committed in the United States. We have selected Los Angeles as the city on which we conduct our analysis. We are interested in finding out who the susceptible victims for certain crimes are. We have picked Los Angeles as it is a populous metropolitan city, with a diverse set of people living in it. There have been multiple studies and claims that portray certain groups, certain crimes and certain areas as more susceptible to danger. We want to see what the conclusions can be for Los Angeles.\nUSA Today claims that the crime rate in Los Angeles soared by 114% in certain neighborhoods from 2019 to 2022. These assertions piqued our interest in these questions[1].\nThe questions we want to answer are:\n\nWe want to know how factors like race, gender, area, time of crime and category of the crime affect the crime and who the victim might be.\nWe want to see if COVID-19 has affected crime rates and what that affect has been.\nHow the crime rates have progressed over the years for different neighborhoods.\nHow the factors of gender, race and age influence the likelihood of experiencing a crime of a sexual nature.\nDetermining what areas are good to live in according to crime rates and what crimes are prevalent in what areas.\n\nThis in turn can help us determine the likelihood of certain crime occurring based on the above factors and that would allow the respective authorities to take preventive measures such as government policies and gun-control rules. We will see if there correlation between the crimes and certain factors which can help us take decide on the precautionary measures to be taken in the future."

These Geographic Areas are sequentially numbered from 1-21.\nAREA NAME\nThe 21 Geographic Areas or Patrol Divisions are also given a name designation that references a landmark or the surrounding community that it is responsible for. For example 77th Street Division is located at the intersection of South Broadway and 77th Street, serving neighborhoods in South Los Angeles\nRpt Dist No\nA four-digit code that represents a sub-area within a Geographic Area.

Additionally, the address fields are only provided to the nearest hundred block to maintain privacy. Location fields are missing in some cases, and have been replaced by (0°, 0°).\nDiscovered issues within the dataset:\n\nTime stamp in date columns are meaningless, since there is a time of occurrence column separately, and all the times in the date column are the beginning of the day.\nX is present in the victim description columns like sex and descent. We will consider these to be instances where the victim would have preferred to be anonymous.\nThere exist rows where though the sex and descent columns are meaningful (not X), the age column contains a 0 (which might seem impossible).\n\nWe plan to import the data by downloading the CSV data file onto our local computer, and then working with it in RStudio by reading this file using read.csv. After we write the code for our project including graphs etc., we will use GitHub to collaborate with each other and contribute to our project."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nTo answer our research questions listed in the introduction, we will follow the below plan.\n• Firstly, we will analyze the missing values in our dataset as follows:\n\nIf the victim description cells are blank with no value entered, we will drop those rows.\nWhile analysing how factors like victim sex and descent affect crime, if the crime committed is against an entity (for example shoplifting etc.), we will neglect the row. If the crime committed is against the person and the columns of sex and descent have ‘X’, then we will drop the rows.\nIf the age is 0 but the columns of sex and descent do not have an ‘X’ entry, we will drop the row considering an age of zero years impossible.\n\nThen we will proceed to answer our research questions by performing the following proposed visualizations:\n\nHow does the age factor affect the likelihood of a crime being committed against a victim?\n\nWe will plot a histogram with a 10-year grouping\n\nHow does the sex factor affect the likelihood of a crime being committed against a victim?\n\nWe will plot a bar chart, with the sex on the x-axis.\n\nHow does the descent factor affect the likelihood of a crime being committed against a victim?\n\nWe will plot a bar chart, with the descent on the x-axis.\n\nHow does the time of crime affect the likelihood of a crime being committed?\n\nWe will plot a histogram with an hourly grouping\n\nHow does crime progress over the years and how did the Covid-19 pandemic affect this?\n\nWe will utilize a time-series to visualize the number of crimes that took place over the range of date, which is 2020-present.\n\nWhat areas are best to live in according to crime occurrences, and which area is the best?\n\nWe will use a Biplot to find the best area to live in. A mosaic plot can be used to find the correlation between type of crime and area of occurrence.\n\nTo determine how factors like age, gender and race affect the likelihood of experiencing a crime of sexual nature?\n\nWe will utilize PCA to find out how much variance the variables capture for the crimes of sexual nature."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"/Users/zainabshakruwala/Downloads/Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv\")\n\n\nOur first plot will showcase the percentage of missing values in each column so that we are made aware of the columns that have mostly missing values (that can be dropped or not be paid attention to in our analysis), and which will also let us understand which variables to focus on to see if there are patterns in missing value columns across crime records.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\n#Adding NA to blank values\ndf[df==\"\"]&lt;-NA\nmissing_percentage &lt;- (colSums(is.na(df)) / nrow(df)) * 100\n\n\nmissing_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  column = names(missing_percentage),\n  percentage = missing_percentage\n)\n\nmissing_df &lt;- missing_df[order(missing_df$percentage), ]\n\nggplot(missing_df, aes(x = reorder(column, percentage), y = percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of Missing Values per Column\",\n    x = \"Column\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Missing Values\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above, we observe that Crm.Cd.4 and Crm.Cd.3 have close to 100% missing values (which are less serious crimes than code 1). The columns of Crm.Cd.2 and Cross.Street also have considerable amount of missing values (&gt;75%). Information of the weapon that was used encoded in columns like Weapon.Used.Cd and Weapon.Desc have more than 50% missing values, which makes sense because some crimes do not involve the use of weapons to be committed. Mocodes, Victim Age and Victim Sex are columns that have around 12% missing values, and their probable reasons have been stated previously in the research plan. Premise Description also has negligible but non-zero missing values in its column. The other columns have zero missing values.\nSo, to analyse the patterns in missing values across columns that have atleast one missing value (since our dataset is too large and analysing all records clearly will not be feasible), we will focus on those columns that firstly have atleast one missing value and secondly have the number of missing values in the range of 50 to 700000. This will allow us to ignore the Crm.Cd columns which are missing for most records, and observe the pattern that a random subset of 50 crime records have with respect to their values of the columns that satisfy this criteria. The subset of 50 is also chosen so that we clearly observe the records on the y axis.\n\n\nCode\nsubset_size &lt;- 50\n# Identify rows with missing values in specific columns\nrows_with_missing &lt;- which(apply(df, 1, function(x) any(is.na(x))))\n\n# Identify columns with missing values in the selected rows\ncolumns_with_missing &lt;- names(which(colSums(is.na(df[rows_with_missing, ])) &gt; 50 & colSums(is.na(df[rows_with_missing, ])) &lt; 700000))\n\n# Randomly subset rows with missing values in specific columns\nrandom_subset &lt;- df[sample(rows_with_missing, subset_size), columns_with_missing, drop = FALSE]\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntidydf &lt;- random_subset %&gt;% \n    rownames_to_column(\"id\") %&gt;% \n    gather(key, value, -id) %&gt;% \n    mutate(missing = ifelse(is.na(value), \"yes\", \"no\"))\n\nggplot(tidydf, aes(x = key, y = fct_rev(id), fill = missing)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Missing Values of a Random Subset\") +\n  ylab('Crime ID') + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe from the above plot that there is some correlation between the occurrence of a missing value entry for victim age and victim sex, since they both go missing simultaneously. This supports our hypothesis stated in the research plan, where we proposed that since the crime in such cases could be caused against some entity or company instead of a singular individual, such details become irrelevant and hence are missing.\nSince the missing value percentage of Premis.Desc column was very low, our random subset has no missing values in this column. As expected, on the other hand, the columns of Weapon related information have higher number of missing values since their percentage was higher too, hence records are more probable to have them missing (both missing at the same time). Mocodes which stands for Modus Operandi refers to activities associated with the suspect in commission of the crime. This also has a strong correlation with the victim age and sex in terms of missing values."
