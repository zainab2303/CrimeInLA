# Introduction
We are interested in finding out who the susceptible victims for a crimes are. We have picked LA as it is a populous city with a diverse set of people living in it. 
There have been multiple studies and claims that portray certain groups, certain crimes and certain areas as more susceptible to danger.We want to see what the conclusions can be for LA.
In particular we want to know what factors like race, gender, area, time of crime and category of the crime affect the crime and who the victim might be. This in turn can help us determine the likelihood of certain crime occuring based on the factors and we can take preventive measures towards it.
We will see if there correlation between the crimes and certain factors which can help us take decide on the precautionary measures to be taken in the future.
